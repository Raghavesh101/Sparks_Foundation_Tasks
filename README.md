# Sparks_Foundation_Tasks
### This is regarding the The Sparks Foundation GRIP Program 2023 where I have completed 2 of the tasks and have uploaded them here
1.   The first task is based on a Linear Regression Model to predict the test score percentage and it's evaluation metrics
2.   The second task is based on EDA on Global Terrorism Dataset to identify trends over time, regional hotspots, dominant terrorist groups, and preferred modes of attacks by the terrorists. All these findings are crucial for devising effective counter-terrorism strategies and interventions.
